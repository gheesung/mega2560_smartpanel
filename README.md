# Smart Home Panel

This smart home panel is developed using ESP-Link firmware. A simple write-up can be found at   [my blog](https://iotdiary.blogspot.sg/2018/04/smart-home-control-panel-using-esp-link.html). A modified version of MCUFRIEND TFT library is used, this can be found in the lib folder.
